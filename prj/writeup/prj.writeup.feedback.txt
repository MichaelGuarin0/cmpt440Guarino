The project attempts to extract states from a Recurrent Neural Network
architecture, Long Short Term Memory, to assemble rules that govern transitions
between states in a Deterministic Finite Automata.
The idea has good merit. 

Overall:
- Decent work well above average of a formal languages student. -10pts

Would you be interested in presenting this at an undergrad conference in MIT 
in the fall? Let me know.
